//! The two questions the editor asks about a document that a single line
//! cannot answer: which statement the caret is in, and which bracket matches
//! the one next to it.
//!
//! Both have an obvious implementation that is wrong at this size — cut the
//! whole buffer into one `&str` and scan it — and materialising a large rope
//! into one on every caret move is exactly the cost the rope was chosen to
//! avoid. So both work over a **window** of the buffer, and the window is grown
//! only as far as the answer needs.
//!
//! # What a statement is here
//!
//! A SQL parser would answer this, and there is none in this tree. What stands
//! in for one is smaller and asks the
//! highlighter instead: a statement runs from the first non-blank byte after
//! the previous semicolon to the semicolon that ends it, and a semicolon counts
//! only when the highlighter did **not** call it part of a string or a comment.
//! That is where all the value was — a `;` inside `'a;b'` is not a terminator —
//! and it comes for free from the colours the editor is drawing anyway. A
//! fragment holding nothing but comments and blanks is not a statement and is
//! skipped; a last statement with no closing semicolon is a statement.
//!
//! A document whose highlighter is [`None`] has no strings and no comments, so
//! every `;` in it terminates. That is the right answer for plain text: it is
//! also the only answer available, and nothing asks the question of a plain
//! text document.
//!
//! # Why a window is sound
//!
//! A semicolon that terminates a statement resets the splitter completely, so a
//! byte offset just past one is a position from which splitting the rest of the
//! document gives the same statements as splitting all of it. [`statement_at`]
//! walks backwards from the caret's line until it has one whole statement
//! behind the caret — so that "the statement before the cursor wins in the gap"
//! can be answered — forwards until it has one whole statement ahead, and
//! splits that window. The answer is the whole-buffer one; the cost is the
//! length of two statements.
//!
//! `MAX_WINDOW` caps it, for the pathological buffer with no semicolon in it
//! at all. A document whose single statement is larger than the cap gets a span
//! that starts at the cap rather than at the statement's true start.
//!
//! # Brackets
//!
//! The same shape, and the same reason the depth counter can be trusted: a
//! bracket the highlighter put inside a string or a comment is not a bracket at
//! all. The scan walks outwards line by line, lexing each line from its cached
//! state, and gives up after `MAX_BRACKET_LINES` of them.
