//! A reusable text field: one line by default, several on request.
//!
//! The implementation is derived from the `input.rs` example shipped with gpui
//! 0.2.2 and extended with the features an application needs: a placeholder, password
//! masking, a disabled state, an `Enter` submit callback and a
//! [`multiline`](TextInput::multiline) mode.
//!
//! All offsets stored in [`TextInput`] are byte offsets into the *real*
//! content. When the field is masked the rendered string is a different byte
//! sequence, so a [`DisplayMap`] translates between the two spaces; that keeps
//! the caret and selection correct for multi-byte text such as Hangul or emoji.
//!
//! # The two modes are one field
//!
//! A multiline field is the same entity with the same offsets; what changes is
//! the geometry. One line is shaped by [`shape_line`] and answers `x_for_index`
//! directly; several are shaped by [`shape_text`], which splits on `\n` and
//! wraps each logical line to the width it was measured at, so every caret
//! question becomes "which row, and where along it". [`TextInput::point_for`]
//! and [`TextInput::offset_for`] are the two directions of that, and every
//! caret movement, mouse press and selection rectangle goes through them —
//! which is what keeps wrapped text, `Up`/`Down` and click-to-place agreeing
//! with one another.
//!
//! [`shape_line`]: gpui::WindowTextSystem::shape_line
//! [`shape_text`]: gpui::WindowTextSystem::shape_text
//!
//! # The edit menu
//!
//! A right-click opens cut / copy / paste / select-all, but only for a field
//! the host has given wording through [`TextInput::context_menu`]: the four
//! labels are user-facing sentences and therefore the host's, and a field that
//! was never given them has no menu. Every row runs the handler its key binding
//! runs, so the menu is a second way in rather than a second implementation.
//!
//! What it is not: a code editor. There is no undo, no syntax highlighting and
//! no gutter — a form field a few lines tall is what the multiline mode exists
//! for, and `ruui-editor` is what a host reaches for when it wants a real one.
