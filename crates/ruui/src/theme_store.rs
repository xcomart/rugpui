//! The user's own UI themes and editor themes, as files.
//!
//! Six chrome themes and six editor themes ship with this crate; anything
//! beyond that comes from a `*.json` file dropped into one of two directories
//! the host application names through [`ThemeDirs`]. Each file's stem is the id
//! the theme is selected by, so `<editor themes>/tokyo-night.json` is the editor
//! theme `tokyo-night`.
//!
//! Where those two directories live is the host's decision and not this
//! crate's: a widget library has no configuration directory of its own, and an
//! application that keeps its settings somewhere unusual — or a test that keeps
//! them in a temporary directory — must not have to fight one. Every entry
//! point below that touches the disk therefore takes a [`ThemeDirs`] as its
//! first argument.
//!
//! The two directories are separate because the two formats are — see
//! [`crate::editor_theme`] — and an id means nothing across them: `dracula` may
//! be a chrome theme, an editor theme, both, or neither, and the two are picked
//! independently.
//!
//! Reading is deliberately forgiving, for the same reason a hand-editable
//! settings file is: these files are meant to be edited by hand, and one broken
//! file must not keep the others — or the application — from loading. A file
//! that cannot be parsed is logged and skipped, as is one whose name collides
//! with a built-in id, since such an entry could never be selected anyway.
//!
//! The formats are [`crate::ThemeFile`] and [`crate::EditorThemeFile`].
