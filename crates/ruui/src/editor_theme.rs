//! Color palette used by the SQL editor, and by nothing else.
//!
//! A separate palette from [`crate::theme`], with its own file format and its
//! own directory, because the two answer different questions. The chrome
//! palette is eleven semantic slots — a surface, a border, a danger — and it
//! has to hold for buttons and tabs and dialogs alike. An editor palette is a
//! *syntax* palette: nineteen slots that only mean anything once a lexer has
//! said which run of characters is a keyword and which is a string, and the
//! published palettes people actually want — Dracula, Gruvbox, Monokai,
//! whatever their editor of choice ships — are written in those terms and no
//! other.
//!
//! Keeping them apart is what lets the two be picked independently — a light
//! chrome around a dark editor is a real preference, not a mistake — and what
//! lets an editor palette be copied out of somewhere else without first being
//! translated into chrome.
//!
//! The shape mirrors [`crate::theme`] exactly, so that whatever is true of one
//! is true of the other: [`EditorTheme`] is the resolved palette and a gpui
//! [`Global`], [`EditorThemeFile`] is the on-disk form,
//! [`crate::theme_store`] reads the files, and [`EditorThemeRegistry`] lists
//! and resolves the built-in and custom themes together. The colors are parsed
//! with the chrome palette's own [`parse_hex`], since `#RRGGBB` is `#RRGGBB`.
//!
//! Unlike the chrome palette, nothing here is derived. Every slot of a syntax
//! palette is a choice its author made about which token deserves which color,
//! and there is no "worked out from the others" answer to that: an operator is
//! not a shade of a keyword. What replaces derivation is forgiveness — a slot
//! that cannot be parsed falls back to the built-in theme of the same
//! *darkness*, so a typo in a light theme cannot drop a near-black keyword onto
//! a near-white page.
