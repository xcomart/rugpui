//! Color palette used by every widget in this crate.
//!
//! The theme is stored as a gpui [`Global`], so any widget that has access to an
//! [`App`] reference can read it without threading it through its constructor.
//!
//! This is the *chrome* palette — panels, tabs, buttons, the result grid. The
//! SQL editor has a palette of its own, with its own file format and its own
//! directory; see [`crate::editor_theme`].
//!
//! # Themes and their ids
//!
//! Six themes ship with the crate. A theme can also come from a file:
//! [`ThemeFile`] is the on-disk form, [`crate::theme_store`] reads the files,
//! and [`ThemeRegistry`] is where the two kinds are listed and resolved
//! together.
//!
//! # Stored colors and derived ones
//!
//! Not every slot of a [`Theme`] is written down. A palette spells out the
//! colors an author chooses — that is [`Palette`], the one gate every theme is
//! built through — and the slots that have to *hold* for any palette whatever
//! are worked out from those. [`Theme::icon`] is the first of them: it is the
//! muted text bent until it clears [`MIN_ICON_CONTRAST`] on both backgrounds,
//! so that a theme nobody checked still draws icons that can be seen.
//!
//! The five grid slots are the second kind of derived color, and they are
//! derived for a different reason: they were added after the format was
//! published. Every theme file written against the eleven-slot format — the
//! hand-written ones, and the ones carried over from logman, whose theme files
//! this crate reads unchanged — has to keep loading, so the grid slots are
//! optional on the way in and worked out from the eleven when they are absent.
//! Unlike [`Theme::icon`] they *can* be spelled out: a grid header is a design
//! choice, not merely a legibility floor, and the six built-in themes all make
//! that choice by hand.
