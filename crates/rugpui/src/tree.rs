//! A virtualised tree whose branches arrive one round trip at a time.
//!
//! The widget knows nothing of what it is showing. It owns the shape of the
//! tree — which nodes are open, which one is selected, where the list is
//! scrolled — while the host owns the nodes themselves and hands them over
//! through [`TreeSource`], keyed by an id the host invents. That split is what
//! keeps a database explorer, a file listing and an object browser the same
//! widget.
//!
//! ## Why a flattened list
//!
//! The tree is drawn as a flat list of the rows that are currently visible,
//! rebuilt whenever the shape changes, and never as nested elements. gpui's
//! [`uniform_list`] only lays out the rows the viewport can see, and it can only
//! do that if the rows are addressable by index — so an open schema with five
//! thousand tables costs the same to draw as an empty one. The children of a
//! collapsed node are not in the list at all, which is also what makes "how many
//! rows are there" and "what does the row below this one hold" answerable
//! without walking anything: arrow keys move by one index, and the subtree of a
//! row is the run of rows after it that are deeper than it is.
//!
//! ## Why loading is in the trait
//!
//! Every node a database explorer opens is a server round trip, so "I do not
//! have these children yet" is not an error state, it is the ordinary one.
//! [`ChildState`] therefore has [`ChildState::NotLoaded`] and
//! [`ChildState::Loading`] beside [`ChildState::Loaded`], and the tree reacts to
//! them rather than asking the host to pretend: an open node with nothing under
//! it yet draws a placeholder row, and the tree emits
//! [`TreeEvent::LoadChildren`] so that the host can go and fetch them. Nothing
//! here ever blocks, and nothing here spawns a task either — the host owns the
//! connection, so the host owns the fetch, and when the answer lands it drops
//! the children into its source and notifies. The tree redraws with them.
//!
//! A request is remembered until the source answers with anything other than
//! [`ChildState::NotLoaded`], so a node is asked for once however many times it
//! is redrawn, and a node whose children the host later drops back to
//! `NotLoaded` is asked again.
//!
//! ## What the host draws
//!
//! The tree draws the indent, the disclosure arrow, the selection and the hover;
//! [`TreeSource::render_row`] draws everything inside the row — icon, label,
//! badges — because only the host knows what a node *is*. It is handed a
//! [`TreeRowInfo`] so that a label can follow the row's state without keeping a
//! copy of it.
