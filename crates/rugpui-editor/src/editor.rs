//! The editor entity: the state, the commands, and the platform input handler.
//!
//! # Offsets, and the one place they are not bytes
//!
//! Every offset stored in an [`EditorView`] is a **byte offset** into the
//! buffer. The lexer returns byte spans, `ropey` indexes by byte, and a caret
//! kept in bytes needs no translation to be compared against either — so the
//! only conversions in this file are at its edges.
//!
//! The edge that matters is [`EntityInputHandler`]. Every platform text input
//! protocol — NSTextInputClient on macOS, IMM/TSF on Windows, the input methods
//! on X11 and Wayland — counts in **UTF-16 code units**, because all three
//! grew up around UTF-16 string types. So the trait's ranges are UTF-16 and the
//! view's are bytes, and `offset_to_utf16` / `offset_from_utf16` sit at every
//! crossing. Getting this wrong is not a rendering glitch: a Hangul syllable is
//! three bytes and one UTF-16 unit, so an off-by-one here puts the caret inside
//! a character, and the next slice panics or the composition overwrites the
//! wrong text. The single-line field in `rugpui` converts by walking the
//! string; this one cannot, and [`crate::buffer`] explains what it does
//! instead.
//!
//! # No `DisplayMap`
//!
//! `rugpui`'s [`TextInput`] keeps a `DisplayMap` between "the bytes stored"
//! and "the bytes drawn", because a password field draws a bullet per grapheme
//! and the caret still has to land on the right character of the real content.
//! **This editor has no such map and needs none**: a code editor renders every
//! byte of the buffer verbatim, so the two spaces are the same space. Masking is
//! the only thing that ever made them differ, and a SQL buffer is never masked.
//! What replaces the map is the line index — the renderer's coordinates are
//! `(line, byte column)` rather than `(byte offset)` — and that translation
//! lives in [`crate::buffer`], where it is exact rather than a lookup table.
//!
//! # Composition
//!
//! The IME contract is the one `TextInput` implements, extended to a buffer
//! with lines in it:
//!
//! * [`EditorView::replace_and_mark_text_in_range`] replaces a range and marks
//!   what it put there. The mark is the underlined run the renderer draws, and
//!   the range it replaces defaults to the existing mark — that is what makes
//!   `ㅎ`, `하`, `한` overwrite each other instead of accumulating.
//! * [`EditorView::replace_text_in_range`] commits, clearing the mark.
//! * [`EditorView::marked_text_range`] answers in UTF-16, because the platform
//!   uses it to place the candidate window.
//!
//! One deliberate departure from `TextInput`. gpui's own input example — which
//! `TextInput` follows byte for byte — maps the new selection with
//! `new_range.start + range.start .. new_range.end + range.end`, adding a
//! *different* base to each end. That is only harmless while the replaced range
//! is empty, which is the case for a field that has never been composed in
//! before; on Windows, where `WM_IME_COMPOSITION` sends a caret position inside
//! a composition that is replacing itself, it produces a selection stretching
//! across the syllable rather than a caret inside it. Here the new selection is
//! resolved against the *inserted text*, which is what the protocol says it is,
//! and `range.start` is the only base.
