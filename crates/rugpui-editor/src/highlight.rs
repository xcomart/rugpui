//! What a highlighter is, and the per-line state cache that makes one
//! incremental.
//!
//! The editor holds no lexer of its own. It holds a [`Highlighter`] — a trait
//! with one method, "give me the coloured runs of this line, given the state
//! the line before it ended in" — and a table of implementations ships with the
//! crate: [`SqlHighlighter`](crate::sql_syntax::SqlHighlighter) and the base
//! languages of [`lang`](crate::lang). An editor with no highlighter at all is
//! a plain-text editor, and that is the default.
//!
//! # Why the state is an opaque integer
//!
//! The obvious signature carries the state as an associated type, so that a
//! highlighter can name its own. That makes the trait not object safe, and the
//! editor has to hold `Arc<dyn Highlighter>`: the highlighter is chosen when a
//! tab is opened, not when the widget is compiled. So the state is
//! [`LineState`], one opaque `u32` that only the highlighter that produced it
//! knows how to read. Every state a line lexer needs — "inside a block
//! comment", "inside a statement, past its colon, inside a single-quoted
//! value" — is a small number, and a `u32` holds all of them with room for a
//! bitfield.
//!
//! [`LineState::START`] is the state the first line of a buffer starts in, and
//! the state every highlighter has to treat as "nothing is open".
//!
//! # What is cached, and what is not
//!
//! Not the spans. Holding a `Vec<Span>` for every line of a large document
//! would cost more than the document does, and it would buy nothing:
//! [`Highlighter::line`] over one line is a few hundred nanoseconds, and the
//! renderer only ever needs the spans of the forty lines it is about to draw.
//! So the cache holds the four bytes per line that *cannot* be recomputed
//! locally — the state each line ends in — and the spans are produced on demand
//! from the state of the line before.
//!
//! After an edit on line *n*, [`SyntaxCache::edited`] re-lexes from *n*
//! downwards and stops at the first line whose new end state equals the one it
//! had. For an edit that opens no comment and no statement — which is nearly
//! every edit — that is one line, whatever the document's length. Typing `/*`
//! on line three of a hundred thousand walks down until the states stop
//! changing, which is either the line that closes the comment or the end of the
//! file; typing the `*/` that closes it walks back down again.
//!
//! [`SyntaxCache::lex_calls`] counts the calls, which is how the tests hold the
//! two claims above down: that drawing costs one call per visible line, and
//! that an ordinary edit costs one call.
