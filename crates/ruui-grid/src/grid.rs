//! The widget: a million rows, drawn a screenful at a time.
//!
//! ## Both axes are virtualised
//!
//! Rows go through gpui's [`uniform_list`], which lays out only what the
//! viewport can reach — the same machinery the tree uses, and the reason a
//! result of any length costs the same to draw.
//!
//! Columns are virtualised here, by hand, because there is no `uniform_list`
//! for them and tables with several hundred columns are real. Every column's
//! left edge is kept in a list the grid rebuilds when a width changes, so the run
//! the content area can see is two binary searches; the rest are neither shaped
//! nor painted, and
//! a row is drawn as one absolutely positioned strip slid left by the scroll
//! offset rather than as a flex row of every cell with the invisible ones
//! clipped. Nothing per frame is proportional to the number of rows or to the
//! number of columns — only to the number of both that fit on screen.
//!
//! The horizontal offset is the grid's own field rather than a gpui scroll
//! container's, for the same reason: a scroll container lays its content out in
//! full, which is exactly the cost being avoided. It also makes the header and
//! the body trivially agree — they read the same number.
//!
//! ## What is measured, and when
//!
//! Which columns are visible depends on how wide the content area is, and that
//! is only known once gpui has laid the frame out. A [`canvas`] in the body
//! reports the size during prepaint and asks for a repaint when it changed, so
//! a resize — and the very first frame — costs one extra frame and nothing
//! after that. The overlay scrollbars already trail a resize by a frame for the
//! same reason.
//!
//! ## What the grid asks the host to do
//!
//! Five things, all of them round trips the widget has no business making:
//! fetching the next batch ([`GridEvent::NearEnd`]), re-running the query in a
//! different order ([`GridEvent::SortRequested`] — the grid never sorts what it
//! holds, because it holds only the first n rows of an answer the server has all
//! of), opening a cell ([`GridEvent::CellActivated`], which is how a LOB
//! reaches a viewer), staging a typed value ([`GridEvent::EditCommitted`]), and
//! drawing the right-click menu ([`GridEvent::ContextMenu`] — the grid has no
//! strings to name items with, design notes §7.8). Copying is *not*
//! among them: gpui owns the clipboard and the grid owns the selection, so the
//! grid does it itself.
//!
//! ## Editing, and the little of it that lives here
//!
//! The grid draws edit state and hosts the field the user types into; it stages
//! nothing and sends nothing. Which rows are marked and which cells are tinted
//! come from [`GridSource::row_status`] and [`GridSource::cell_dirty`], asked
//! only about what is on screen; whether a cell can be typed into at all comes
//! from [`GridSource::cell_editable`].
//!
//! The field itself has to be here for one reason: it is placed over a cell, and
//! nothing else knows where a cell is. A cell's rectangle falls out of
//! `laid_out`, `h_offset`, the row height and the list's scroll offset — four
//! numbers the grid keeps and nobody else sees — so [`GridView::begin_edit`]
//! owns the [`TextInput`] rather than the host owning it and asking where to put
//! it.
//!
//! **A close commits.** `Enter`, focus going elsewhere, a sort, a refresh, a
//! scroll, a column dragged — all of them end the edit by raising
//! [`GridEvent::EditCommitted`], and only `Escape` throws the typing away. The
//! asymmetry is deliberate: what is committed is *staged*, not sent, so the cost
//! of committing something the user did not mean is one undo in the pending
//! changes, while the cost of discarding is the typing. Committing an unchanged
//! field raises nothing at all, so the common case — open a cell, look at it,
//! move on — is silent either way.
