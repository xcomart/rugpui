//! Where a grid gets its rows, and the shape it insists on seeing them in.
//!
//! The grid never touches a result set. It is handed one through [`GridSource`],
//! exactly as the tree is handed its nodes through
//! [`TreeSource`](ruui::TreeSource) — and for a sharper reason than reuse:
//! the thing a real grid is showing is a batch handed over by whatever fetched
//! it, and a crate that knew that type would need the fetcher — a database
//! driver, a JVM, a network — to run its own unit tests. Behind this trait
//! a test source is twenty lines and a million rows cost nothing, which is what
//! makes "does it still only touch the visible rows?" a thing that can be
//! asserted rather than eyeballed.
//!
//! ## Values are already strings
//!
//! [`GridCell::Text`] borrows from the source rather than owning, so drawing a
//! screenful of cells allocates nothing per cell for the value itself. That is
//! only possible because the values *are* strings by the time they reach here:
//! whatever decodes the wire hands over its text already decoded, and a grid is
//! a view of text. A source that would have to
//! format a number on the way out has nowhere to put the result, which is the
//! constraint saying so.
//!
//! ## Null is not empty
//!
//! [`GridCell::Null`] and `GridCell::Text("")` are different values and are
//! drawn differently — the marker `NULL` in [`Theme::grid_null`], against a cell
//! with nothing in it. Too many tools cannot tell you which one is in front of
//! you (design notes, §7.5), and a source that flattens the two here
//! has already lost the distinction whatever the widget does.
//!
//! ## What has been changed is the source's business too
//!
//! A grid that can be edited has to draw three more things: which rows have
//! been touched ([`GridSource::row_status`]), which individual cells carry the
//! change ([`GridSource::cell_dirty`]), and which cells will accept one at all
//! ([`GridSource::cell_editable`]). None of that is state the widget keeps.
//! Staging an edit means knowing the table behind the result and the key that
//! aims an `UPDATE` at a row, which is knowledge this crate deliberately does
//! not have (design notes, §7.5) — so the host wraps its result in
//! something that stages, and answers these three the way it already answers
//! [`GridSource::cell`].
//!
//! All three are defaulted to "nothing has been changed and nothing may be",
//! which is the truth for the read-only sources — a plan, a `DESCRIBE`, a diff
//! — that are half of what the grid is pointed at.
//!
//! [`Theme::grid_null`]: ruui::Theme#structfield.grid_null
